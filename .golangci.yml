    - cyclop # Go linter that checks if the cyclic complexity of a function is acceptable
    - dogsled # Checks assignments with too many blank identifiers (e.g. x, , , _, := f())
    - dupl # Tool for code clone detection
    - errorlint # errorlint is a linter for that can be used to find code that will cause problems with the error wrapping scheme introduced in Go 1.13.
    - exhaustive # check exhaustiveness of enum switch statements
    - exportloopref # checks for pointers to enclosing loop variables
    - funlen # Tool for detection of long functions
    - gochecknoglobals # A global variable is a variable declared in package scope and that can be read and written to by any function within the package.
    - gocritic # Provides diagnostics that check for bugs, performance and style issues.
    - goconst # Inspects source code for security problems
    - gocyclo # Computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions
    - goerr113 # Golang linter to check the errors handling expressions
    - gofmt # Gofmt checks whether code was gofmt-ed. By default this tool runs with -s option to check for code simplification
    - goimports # In addition to fixing imports, goimports also formats your code in the same style as gofmt.
    - gomnd # An analyzer to detect magic numbers.
    - goprintffuncname # Checks that printf-like functions are named with f at the end
    - gosec # Inspects source code for security problems
    - misspell # Finds commonly misspelled English words in comments
    - nakedret # Finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length
    - nestif # Reports deeply nested if statements
    - nilerr # Finds the code that returns nil even if it checks that the error is not nil.
    - noctx # noctx finds sending http request without context.Context
    - nolintlint # Reports ill-formed or insufficient nolint directives
    - prealloc # Finds slice declarations that could potentially be pre-allocated
    - promlinter # Check Prometheus metrics naming via promlint
    - revive # Fast, configurable, extensible, flexible, and beautiful linter for Go. Drop-in replacement of golint.
    - unconvert # Remove unnecessary type conversions
    - unparam # Reports unused function parameters
    - whitespace # Tool for detection of leading and trailing whitespace
