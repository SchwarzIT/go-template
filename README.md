## Usage

### Installation

#### From source

If you have Go 1.21+, you can directly install by running:

```bash
go install github.com/schwarzit/go-template/cmd/gt@latest
```

> Based on your go configuration the `go/template` binary can be found in `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` in case `$GOPATH` is not set.
> Make sure to add the respective directory to your `$PATH`.
> [For more information see go docs for further information](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-install). Run `go env` to view your current configuration.

#### From the released binaries

Download the desired version for your operating system and processor architecture from the [go-template releases page](https://github.com/SchwarzIT/go-template/releases).
Make the file executable and place it in a directory available in your `$PATH`.

#### nix

`go-template` also provides a [flake.nix](flake.nix) to install it via [nix package manager](https://github.com/NixOS/nix).

You can also try out `go-template` without installing:

```shell
nix run github:schwarzit/go-template
```

### Preconditions

`go/template`'s `gt` CLI requires at least the following executables on `$PATH` to run succesfully:

- Go >= 1.21
- Git

These are used at the end of `gt new`'s execution to initialize Git and Go modules in the newly created project repository.

### Initialize your repo from the template

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/441624.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/441624?autoplay=1&speed=2&size=medium)

Use the template to generate your repo:

```bash
gt new
```

Initialize the project:

```bash
cd <your project>
make all
```

## Options

To get an overview of all options that can be set for the template you can take a look at the [options docs](docs/options.md), run the CLI or check out the [testing example values file](pkg/gotemplate/testdata/values.yml).
