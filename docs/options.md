# Options

The following sections describe all options that are currently available for go/template for templating.
The options are divided into base options and extension options.
Base options are needed for the minimal base template and are mandatory in any case.
The extension options on the other hand enable optional features in the template such as gRPC support or open source lincenses.

## Base

| `projectDescription` | Description of the project used in the README. |
| `appName` | The name of the binary that you want to create.<br>Could be the same as your "projectSlug" but since Go supports multiple apps in one repo it could also be sth. else.<br>For example if your project is for some API there could be one app for the server and one CLI client. |
